jPasswordGen
============

This is a little password generator written mostly in JavaScript (jQuery).
A friend and I challenged each other with the task who could write the better password generator. He decided to write his generator in Java, my decision was for JavaScript as you can see. We compared those two generators and guess who won? ME!! Yes haha. The generators had to fulfill the following tasks:
<ul>
  <li>generate a password with 2 million symbols.</li>
  <li>generate a password with 20 million symbols.</li>
</ul>
Well. While my generator finished the first task after about 6 seconds and the second task after 68 seconds we still had to wait for the passwords generated by the Java program.
